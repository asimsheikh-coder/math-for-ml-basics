# 🧮 Math for Machine Learning — Foundational Concepts

## 📄 Abstract
This project introduces the fundamental mathematical principles that form the foundation of **Machine Learning (ML)**.  
The notebook titled **"Math_for_ML_Basics.ipynb"** demonstrates essential concepts such as **mean, variance, correlation, and Bayes’ theorem** through simple Python programs and visualizations.  
The purpose of this project is to bridge the gap between high school mathematics and the advanced concepts used in data science and artificial intelligence.

## 🧩 Topics Covered
| No. | Concept | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Mean, Median, and Mode** | Measures of central tendency — summarizing data. |
| 2️⃣ | **Variance and Standard Deviation** | Understanding data spread and variability. |
| 3️⃣ | **Probability Distributions** | Visualizing how random variables behave (Normal Distribution). |

## 🧠 Key Insights
- **Mean & Median** help summarize data points into a single representative value.  
- **Variance** and **Standard Deviation** describe how data points differ from the mean.  
- **Normal Distribution** plays a central role in data modeling and prediction.  
- **Correlation** reveals whether two variables move together or independently.  
- **Bayes’ Theorem** introduces reasoning under uncertainty — a core idea in ML models.
